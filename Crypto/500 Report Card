The first part of the challenge is a report card. Indexing into the name of the course with
the grade received (A = look at first letter, B=2nd, C=3rd, D=4th, F=5th)
  ○ This gives SUBDERMATOGLYPHIC
      ● Googling subdermatoglyphic should bring up the isogram wikipedia page.
      ● The hint text above the report card implies that you should use isogramming as a technique for getting meaning out of the flags from the proceeding challenges.
      ● The duplicated letters from the flags spell NIGHTMARES , the final flag.
